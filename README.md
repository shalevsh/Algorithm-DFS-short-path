Algorithm that find the shortest paths Between two vertices in Graph using BFS

Algorithm that find the shortest paths Between two vertices in Graph

for this Algorithm i implement by myself a LinkedList,Queue , BFS Algorithm and a graph with Adjacency Matrix

The program get the number of vertices in the graph (n) and two vertex s,t and edges. the Algorithm finds the shortest path in graph between s & t.

Steps: 1.build the graph with the inputes (edges) as a Adjacency Matrix.

2.run bfs from vertex s.

3.remove from the graph all the edges that not in bfs tree.

4.invert the graph. 5.run bfs from vertex t.

6.remove all the edges that inaccessible from t. 7.invert the graph again.
